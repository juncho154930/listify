`npm run serve`

##Amplify
some next steps:
"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify <category> add" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify publish" to deploy everything
